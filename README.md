# mystoreJEE
A Single Page Application (SPA) architected with JEE using Glassfish, JPA/EclipseLink, MySQL, JAX-RS/REST, AngularJS and Bootstrap
This project is for the express purpose of demonstrating specific technologies as follows (and thus is not fully featured currently with logging, security and error handling aspects):
Application Server: Glassfish 4
JPA: EclipseLink
REST: JAX-RS
DBMS: MySQL

NOTE: The UI layer has been created separately to confirm/support separation of concerns between the back-end and the UI. The project is in a separate repository called mystore-ui and uses AngularJS and Bootstrap.
